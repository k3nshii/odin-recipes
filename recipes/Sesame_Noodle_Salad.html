    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This amazing salad recipe was given to me by a friend who used to know someone at the now closed Larry's Markets in the Seattle area. I've added to the recipe a little -- so it's not exactly the same... but better! I take this to every picnic and everyone loves it! May also add diced chicken for a variation.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta</li>
        <li>½ cup sesame oil</li>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon hot chili oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame seeds, or more if desired</li>
        <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the angel hair pasta, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.</li>
        <li>Whisk together the sesame oil, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, chili oil, and sugar in a large bowl. Toss the pasta in the dressing, then sprinkle with sesame seeds, green onion, and bell pepper. Serve warm, or cover and refrigerate for a cold salad.</li>
    </ol>
